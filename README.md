ZKTorch — Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Training

This repository extends ZKTorch from proving only inference to proving entire training steps (forward pass, backward pass, and optimizer update) in zero knowledge.

The work focuses on making training a verifiable state transition, enabling future constructions such as Proof of Aggregation (PoA) and recursive proof folding for long-horizon training.

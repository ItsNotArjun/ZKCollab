# Secure Cross Silo Federated Learning



<!-- This repository extends ZKTorch from proving only inference to proving entire training steps (forward pass, backward pass, and optimizer update) in zero knowledge.

The work focuses on making training a verifiable state transition, enabling future constructions such as Proof of Aggregation (PoA) and recursive proof folding for long-horizon training. -->

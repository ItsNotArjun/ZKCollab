### FAQ 



# how does training, verification , proving all happen i.e the orchestration flow?
Please refer to the Orchestration.md file in the repo root to know this.




# in this repo, we have proved Algebraic SGD not Arithemtic SGD.

- Algebraic sgd is : 

- Arithmetic sgd is:

- Arithmetic sgd requires


# whats the flow of proof construction 
Single-step PoT
Bound PoT (on-chain dataset/policy/seed)
Recursive PoT over many local steps
Multi-round recursion across FL rounds
Then Proof of Aggregation on top of those round-level results
